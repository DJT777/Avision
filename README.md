 This repository is based on JK-Jung's TensorRT demos at https://github.com/jkjung-avt/tensorrt_demos. It serves as a backup of my files, and is not intended to be immediately cloned and run by anyone.

To run this repository I use the following commands:

source deepsort_env/bin/activate
python3 trt_yolo_final_pymysql.py -m yolov4-tiny-synth-mk1 --ub 0 --height 720 --width 1280
